  # because the cla workflow will run on worflows generated from forks, they do not have access to secrets
  # pull_request_target only runs the workflow on the master branch but allows access to secrets

  # the one downside of this approach is that making changes to the cla workflow itself is more tedious. For development purposes
  # the cla workflow will need to be manually tested using workflow_dispatch in the actions tab.

  # Workflows that are in required checks have to run in merge queue.

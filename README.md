# Repositories open to contributions
This repository holds the list of repositories where external contributions are allowed.
In these, external contributions are allowed when the code owner of the Pull Request has agreed to DFINITY's Contributor License Agreement.

The list is in a text format where each line represents the name of one repository.

To unlock a repository, you should create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dfinity/repositories-open-to-contributions/compare) where you add the name in alphabetical order.

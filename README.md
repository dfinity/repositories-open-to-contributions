# Repositories open to contributions
This repository holds the list of repositories where external contributions are allowed.
In these, external contributions are allowed when the code owner of the Pull Request has agreed to DFINITY's Contributor License Agreement.

The list is in a text format where each line represents the name of one repository.

Here is an example for https://github.com/dfinity/sdk and https://github.com/dfinity/ic it would be (always in alphabetical order): 
```
ic
sdk
```

To unlock a repository, you should create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dfinity/repositories-open-to-contributions/compare) where you add the name in alphabetical order. Be sure to create a new branch within this repository, a PR from a forked repository will not work.

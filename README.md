# Repositories open to external contributions
This repository holds the list of repositories accepting external contributions.
In these, external contributions are allowed when the code owner of the Pull Request has agreed to DFINITY's Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This repository also contains the workflow for verifying that the CLA has been signed for external contributors. For more information, refer to [CLA-workflow](CLA-workflow.md)

The open-repositories list is in a text format where each line represents the name of one repository within the `dfinity` org. Here is an example for https://github.com/dfinity/sdk and https://github.com/dfinity/ic. It needs to be in alphabetical order:
```
ic
sdk
```

To unlock a repository, you should create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dfinity/repositories-open-to-contributions/compare) where you add the name in alphabetical order. Be sure to create a new branch within this repository, a PR from a forked repository will not work.
